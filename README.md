Title: Iron production of Roman Vicus of Eisenberg: provenance and thecnology. 

Abstract 

The Roman Vicus of Eisenberg, localized in Pfalz, Germany, and founded approximately in the 20 BC, is well known for its iron smelting remains. In the last systematic excavations (1995-2006), iron ores, slags, blooms and final iron objects were found inside the houses of the Vicus. Part of these remains (ores, slag and a bloom) were analyzed for the first time with archaeometallurgical methods by (Mittelstädt (2019), combining a metallographic Optical Microscopy (OP), a Scanning Electron Microscope - Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (SEM-EDS), a mineralogical analysis with X-ray Diffractometry (XRD), and a chemical analysis with a Wavelength Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (WDXF) with the aim of identifying their context in the archaeological record (primary or secondary), the metallurgical process of their formation (smelting: oven slag, flow slags and plate slags; and smiting slags) and the possible ores sources.

In this thesis we continued with the analysis of new ores from the possible past sources (XRD), the metallographic analysis of the iron objects (OP), and the revision of the previously analyzed material, using for the first time the slag chemistry model approach. This approach proposes that the chemistry of the slag and the slag inclusions present in iron objects depends on the ore chemistry and the alterations and enrichment caused during the smelting and the smithing processes. This approach requires analyzing main oxide compounds (SEM-EDS and WXRDF) and  trace elements. For this last reason, the material was chemically analyzed using a sensitive microanalytical technique, Laser Ablation - Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), on the ores, slags, and slags inclusions in iron objects. 

The results of this analysis, combined with standard statistical methods (descriptive and explorative statistic, PCA, LDA and HCA), lead us to conclude that all the materials come from a similar process based on the main compounds, but the variants of some elements may be related to different raw materials %(MnO and P$_2$O$_5$) 
and processes. ).  
Incompatible trace elements, like rare earth and radioactive elements, confirm the common origin of the iron production, and allow us to discriminate the material sources, pointing to two ores deposits. In conclusion, the combination of this multidisciplinary approach makes it possible to define a possible chemical fingerprint for the Eisenberg iron production and their compatible ores sources.

About the repostory

The ipny files are the python script using Jupyter notebook, the  csv files are the raw data materials:  
  - Linear REE - are trace elements linear chondritic normalize plots - csv data_ree-normaliez - plots REE
  - Multivariant are the PCA, LDA and HCA -csvs = la_bloom, la_SI and La_powder - plots MV
  - K.M. thesis plots are the plots using the same data from the previus thesis - csv KM_data and weight - plots in the general folder or in the script
  - Main and Trace elements are the rest of the statistical analisis and plots, in general generated in loops for all the elements. - csv la_trace_samples and data_main_ms - most of the plots had their own folder, sometimes one for main and other for trace, the descriptive statistic and the new data-set are in results folder in csv files.
